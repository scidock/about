Any use of the Service is subject to the following Terms and Conditions of Use
("*Terms and Conditions*"), as well as our [Privacy Policy](./privacy.html) which is
incorporated by reference into these Terms and Conditions.

### 2. Account and data
If you create an account on the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the security

unauthorized uses of your data, your account or any other breaches of
security. SciDock LLC will not be liable for any acts or omissions by You,
including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
omissions. SciDock LLC may from time to time set storage limits for your

manage the Service. SciDock LLC Base may also from time to time change its
policies on offering commercial content or displaying advertising, and it
may do this without notice.

### 3. Responsibility of service visitors
SciDock LLC has not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material posted to
the Service, and cannot therefore be responsible for that material's
content, use or effects. By operating the Service, SciDock LLC does not
represent or imply that it endorses the material there posted, or that it
believes such material to be accurate, useful or non-harmful. You are
responsible for taking precautions as necessary to protect yourself and
your computer systems from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other
harmful or destructive content. The Service may contain content that is
offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable, as well as content
containing technical inaccuracies, typographical mistakes, and other
errors. The Service may also contain material that violates the privacy or
publicity rights, or infringes the intellectual property and other
proprietary rights, of third parties, or the downloading, copying or use
of which is subject to additional terms and conditions, stated or
unstated. SciDock LLC disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting
from the use by visitors of the Service, or from any downloading by those
visitors of content there posted.

### 4. Content posted to other websites
We have not reviewed, and cannot review, all of the material, including computer
software, made available through the websites and webpages to which LaTeX
Base links, and that link to LaTeX Base. SciDock LLC does not have any
control over those non-LaTeX Base websites and webpages, and is not
responsible for their contents or their use. By linking to a non-LaTeX
Base website or webpage, SciDock LLC does not represent or imply that it
endorses such website or webpage. You are responsible for taking
precautions as necessary to protect yourself and your computer systems
from viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other harmful or destructive
content. SciDock LLC disclaims any responsibility for any harm resulting
from your use of non-LaTeX Base websites and webpages.

### 5. Copyright infringement and DMCA policy
As SciDock asks others to respect its intellectual property rights, it
respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that
material located on or linked to by LaTeX Base violates your copyright,
you are encouraged to notify SciDock LLC by writing to
[admin@scidock.com](mailto:admin@scidock.com). SciDock LLC will
respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by
removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing
material. In the case of a visitor who may infringe or repeatedly
infringes the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of SciDock
LLC or others, SciDock LLC may, in its discretion, terminate or deny
access to and use of the Service. In the case of such termination, SciDock
LLC will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously
paid.
