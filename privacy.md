# Privacy

### Privacy Policy, updated March 8, 2018

Your privacy is critically important to us. At SciDock LLC, we have a
few fundamental principles:

- We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
- We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply
  with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.
- We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for
  the on-going operation of one of our services.
- We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s
  visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and
  permanently deleted.

It is our policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may
collect while operating our website.


This privacy statement describes how (*LaTeX Base by SciDock LLC*)
collects and uses the personal information you provide on our
websites latexbase.com and scidock.com. It also describes the choices
available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how
you can access and update this information.

### Website visitors

Like most websites, LaTeX Base collects non-personally-identifying
information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make
available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site,
and the date and time of each visitor request. LaTeX Base’s purpose in
collecting non-personally-identifying information is to better understand
how LaTeX Base’s visitors use its website. From time to time, LaTeX Base
may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g.,
by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

LaTeX Base also collects potentially personally-identifying information
like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. LaTeX Base does not use such
information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such
information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and
discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.

### Gathering of personally-identifying information


Certain visitors to LaTeX Base choose to interact with LaTeX Base in ways
that require LaTeX Base to gather personally-identifying information. The
amount and type of information that LaTeX Base gathers depends on the
nature of the interaction. For example, we ask users who sign up for a
premium account at LaTeX Base to provide an email address and password. In
each case, LaTeX Base collects such information only insofar as is
necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's
interaction with LaTeX Base. LaTeX Base does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And
visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information,
with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain
website-related activities.

### Aggregated statistics

LaTeX Base may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
website and mobile applications. For instance, LaTeX Base may monitor how
long it takes to compile documents on the LaTeX Base site. LaTeX Base may
display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, LaTeX
Base does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
described below.

### How we handle PII

SciDock LLC discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees,
contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that
information in order to process it on SciDock's behalf or to provide
services available at LaTeX Base's website, and (ii) that have agreed not
to disclose it to others.

### Security

The security of your personal information is important to us. We follow
generally accepted industry standards to protect the personal information
submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it, and our
website is protected by HTTPS encryption. No method of transmission over
the Internet is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its
absolute security. If you have any questions about security on our
website, you can contact us at [support@latexbase.com](mailto:support@latexbase.com).

### Data retention

We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or
as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel your account or
request that we no longer use your information to provide you services,
contact us at [support@latexbase.com](mailto:support@latexbase.com).
We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal
obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.

Policy, please send an email to [support@latexbase.com](support@latexbase.com).

### Privacy policy changes

SciDock LLC reserves the right to modify this privacy statement at any
time, so please review it frequently. If we change how we use your
personally identifiable information, we will notify, by email, and/or by
means of a notice on our website prior to the change becoming effective.
